# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The website showcases my skills, projects, and includes a contact form that either sends emails or shows messages in an admin panel.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Contact Form**: A contact form for visitors to get in touch with me. The form sends an email or stores messages in an admin panel.
- **Analytics**: Integration with monitoring tools to track unique visitors, user interactions, and more.
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Dockerized for multiarch builds, supporting both Intel and ARM-based systems.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
